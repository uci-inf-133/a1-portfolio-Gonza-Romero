--Readme document for Gonzalo Romero Navarrete, gromeron@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

9/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 2/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 1/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment (1/2 for spirit because of my overall content which I would assume compared to others is not as good or filled in as it should be)

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

-Image with alt attribute, the profile picture I have has a descriptive alt text telling the user what it is
-External links, I use one external link which links to the UCI informatics page and opens up a new tab to do that.
-Multiple pages with navigation, four in total with a consistent navigation process being on all four pages.
-Semantic HTML tags are used, such as header, nav, main, section, and footer so that the files are properly structured and so that it would be easier to read and understand.



(b) CSS features

-Padding and margins, which is applied throughout the entire web page
-Color changes/modifications to implement a dark theme which was still not the darkest since its something I preferred for my portfolio.
-Bootstrap CSS helpers such as Bootstrap’s grid system, using methods like col, col-md, and cold-ld. Button styling is also used to create rounded bubble looking buttons.
-Google fonts is also used, preferred to use Inter Tight font family compared to the one showed in the lecture on CSS.



(c) Advanced features

-Complex page layout with the use of a responsive sidebar navigation which changes in direction depending on the device you view the portfolio.
    It uses bootstraps grid system for the responsive behavior
    Shows navigation buttons horizontally depending on the screen size
    Changes column widths as well depending on size of screen
    Using padding to create more a distance between the buttons on the sidebar
    Full height side bar on desktop, will add more in the future since it is empty for the rest of the bottom of the page for desktop users viewing it




3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

-The accessibility checker flagged lots of warnings but not actual problems. Side note: In specific “potential problems” and not “likely problems” or “known problems”. 
Profile image warning on index.html file. I ignored this because the checker was questioning if the alt text described the picture in detail and contained the same information as the image but it did, and I took inspiration from the slides in order to name the profile alt text.
Skip to content link issue that I ignored since although may be taken care, for my current portfolio, to me does not seem as crucial because of the minimal content on my portfolio.
Headings formatting- Fixed this issue since I skipped from header 1 to header 3, made the change from header 3 to header 2 and issue resolved.
Ignored issues about title might not describe a document, which each document did have a properly clear title, describing what the document is about.
P element may be misused, ignoring this since it was specific data about the projects I had done and written about in the project.html file.
-I also ignored the css although it showed red as in having an issue, the the code from the css styling on inter tight google fonts is real and was taken from the embeded code in the site itself


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

-It took me 9-10 hours to complete this assignment.



5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

-Bootstrap documentation - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
-Google fonts page to scroll and look through the different fonts - https://fonts.google.com/
-MDN Web Docs for CSS - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS
-Youtube Tutorials
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjNEMXZA-k&list=LL
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw
More of git control rather than assignment contents but still used it for this assignment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6ADS2k8oNQ&list=LL&index=7
-I used Claude for understanding the bootstrap grid system further and to come up with different design patterns since I was taking a while to choose a specific design that I took inspiration from and how to approach the overall build design of my portfolio. Queries was asking about further explanation on the bootstrap grid system and the other one was about where to look for inspiration on portfolio and what were the best practices in order to build a proper portfolio to then edit and make changes in the future more “easier”.



6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

-I did not consult with classmates or with other individuals for this assignment.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

-Open “index.html” in the web browser of choice.
-All the pages are linked through the sidebar navigation buttons.
-The website used the latest version of Bootstrap which was shown to us during lecture and the google fonts Inter Tight.
-The profile image named “profilepic.jpg” should be displayed properly since it is and will be in the final zip folder uploaded to canvas and on github repository.
